# Node Boats!
This was a [hack day][hackday] at [JSConf 2014][jsconf].  Our team was
comprised of:

- Matthew Drooker
- Brian O'Neil
- James Young
- Matt Crutchfield

The goals of our team were to create a node powered boat, race it across a pool,
and win.  We successfully accomplished all three goals.
